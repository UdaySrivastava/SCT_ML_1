# SCT_ML_1

## Problem Statement : Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

This project involves implementing a linear regression model to predict house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The goal is to build an accurate model that can learn from a dataset of house attributes and corresponding prices and use it to estimate prices for new houses. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of supervised learning, feature selection, and model evaluation in machine learning.

`SCT_ML_1.ipynb` contains the code for the linear regression model that has been developed to predict house prices.
